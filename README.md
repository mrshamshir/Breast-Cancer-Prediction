# Breast Cancer Analysis and Prediction

Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.<p>It arises in the lining cells (epithelium) of the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) in the glandular tissue of the breast. Initially, the cancerous growth is confined to the duct or lobule (“in situ”) where it generally causes no symptoms and has minimal potential for spread (metastasis).<br>
    
Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample - or biopsy - of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.

I have tried my best to explain the code very clearly. In this notebook, I will be using 4 classification models- Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
